# Graph_Bridge Solver
Welcome to the Graph_Bridge Solver! This Python script analyzes a graph to identify bridges and non-bridges, and visualizes the graph with the identified edges.

## Description

This script utilizes the NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries to perform the following tasks:
- Takes input for the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
- Accepts user input for edges between vertices.
- Identifies bridges and non-bridges in the graph.
- Visualizes the original graph and a graph with labeled bridge and non-bridge edges.

## How to Use

1. **Run the script:**
   - Execute `python graph_bridge_solver.py` in your terminal.
2. **Enter the total number of vertices:**
   - Input the number of vertices in the graph.
3. **Enter the total number of edges:**
   - Input the number of edges in the graph.
4. **Input edges between vertices:**
   - Follow the prompts to input edges between vertices.
5. **View the results:**
   - The script will display details about bridges, non-bridges, and the total components in the graph.
   - Two visualizations will be shown: the original graph and a graph with labeled bridge and non-bridge edges.
